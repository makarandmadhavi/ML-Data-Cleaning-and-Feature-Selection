    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use a dataset for predictive learning and check the quality of the data and determine which features are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the data types? (Only numeric and categorical)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the likely distributions of the numeric variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which independent variables are useful to predict a target (dependent variable)? (Use at least three methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which independent variables have missing data? How much? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Do the training and test sets have the same data?\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which predictor variables are the most important?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do the ranges of the predictor variables make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the distributions of the predictor variables?   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove outliers and keep outliers (does if have an effect of the final predictive model)?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove 1%, 5%, and 10% of your data randomly and impute the values back using at least 3 imputation methods. How well did the methods recover the missing values?  That is remove some data, check the % error on residuals for numeric data and check for bias and variance of the error.\n",
